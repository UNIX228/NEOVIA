# NEOVIA

**NEOVIA** is a universal graphics and performance enhancement system for Nintendo Switch games that improves visuals and performance **without overclocking**.

Everything works from a single `/graphics/` folder on your SD card. All controls are managed through the NEOVIA app.

NEOVIA does **not** overclock your console's CPU, GPU, or touchscreen frequencies.

Improvements are achieved through advanced configuration of shaders, textures, level of detail, filtering, and other graphical components.
