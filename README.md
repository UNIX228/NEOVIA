# NEOVIA

**NEOVIA** is a universal enhancement system for Nintendo Switch games that improves graphics and performance **without overclocking**.  
Everything works from a single folder named `/graphics/` on your SD card. All controls are managed through the NEOVIA application.

NEOVIA does **not** overclock your console or touch hardware frequencies.  
Improvements are achieved through advanced configuration of shaders, textures, LOD, filtering, and other graphical components.
